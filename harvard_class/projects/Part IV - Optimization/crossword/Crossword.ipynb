    "## Instructions\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to generate a crossword puzzle by treating it as a constraint satisfaction problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each sequence of squares (for one word) is **ONE VARIABLE**\n",
    "* The **Domains** are each possible word given to put into the puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to decide which word in the domain of all possible words can fill a given variable sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each variable is defined by these values:\n",
    "1. the row and col it begins on (i, j) respectively\n",
    "2. the direction of the word (either DOWN or ACROSS)\n",
    "3. the length of the word\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/ex1.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable 1, for example, would be a variable represented by a row of 1 (assuming 0 indexed counting from the top), a column of 1 (also assuming 0 indexed counting from the left), a direction of across, and a length of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in crossword puzzles have both unary and binary constraints. \n",
    "The **Unary Constraint** of a crossword variable is given by its **length**, for variable 1 above, the value 'byte' would satisfy the unary constraint, but the value 'bit' would not. **Any values that don’t satisfy a variable’s unary constraints can therefore be removed from the variable’s domain immediately.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **binary constraints** on a variable are **its overlap with neighboring variables**. Variable 1 has a single neighbor: Variable 2. Variable 2 has two neighbors: Variable 1 and Variable 3. For each pair of neighboring variables, those variables share an overlap: a single square that is common to them both. We can represent that overlap as the character index (i,j) in each variable’s word that must be the same character.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the overlap between Variable 1 and Variable 2 might be represented as the pair (1, 0), meaning that Variable 1’s character at index 1 necessarily must be the same as Variable 2’s character at index 0 (assuming 0-indexing, again). The overlap between Variable 2 and Variable 3 would therefore be represented as the pair (3, 1): character 3 of Variable 2’s value must be the same as character 1 of Variable 3’s value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we’ll add the additional constraint that **all words must be different: the same word should not be repeated multiple times in the puzzle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge ahead, then, is write a program to find a satisfying assignment: a different word (from a given vocabulary list) for each variable such that all of the unary and binary constraints are met."

For any two distinct variables v1 and v2, crossword.overlaps[v1, v2] will be None if the two variables have no overlap, and will be a pair of integers (i, j) if the variables do overlap.

    "\n",
    "* **save()** - a method that generates an image file corresponding to a given assignment\n",
