    "task of learning a function mapping an input point to a discrete category (example, red or blue, rain or not rain, authentic or counterfit)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **k-nearest-neighbor classification** - a classification algorithm that, given an input, chosses teh most common class out of the k nearest data point to that input\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Classification example:**\n",
    "* inputs for ml algorithm: x1 = humidity, x2 = pressure\n",
    "* given the two above inputs, use hypothesis function h(x1, x2) in order to predict weather. \n",
    "* linear combinations (or weights) are assigned to each input in side of the function like: h(x1, x2) = Rain if w0 + w1*x1 + w2*x2 >= 0 else NO Rain\n",

    "* **Vectors** are often used for various value sequences, i.e. a vector for all the weights and a vector for all the inputs\n",

    "* If the actual value < than hypothesis, weights need to decrease\n",

    "the above analysis we've performed on the whether will return only two possibilites, Rain and No Rain based on a threshold set by the ML algorithm.

    "In order to evaluate the results of a hypothesis functions, optimization methodologies can be used. Recall that with optimization, cost functions were used. In learning algorithms, loss functions can be used in a similar manner.\n",

    "**Loss Function** - a function that expresses how poorly our hypothesis performs\n",

    "If a data point maches the prediction, then it is assigned a value of 0 and no loss occurs, however, if it misses a prediction then a value of 1 is assigned and loss occurs. All losses would be summed together for the total loss, 4 in the image below: \n",
    "\n",

    "The loss number can then be used to rate the results. If a different linear regression line is used that decreases the number of losses then that would be preferable. The goal is to try and minimze the loss amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**L1 Loss Function** - used for continous values rather than discrete (company example) which takes into account both how close the predition was to actual values and how far apart they ultimately were. For example in the case of the advertising budget to sales results, we want the prediction to match the actual results, but if not we care how close our prediction came to results. \n",
    "* L1(actual, predicted) = abs(actual - predicted)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**L2 Loss Function** - similar to L1 loss function but uses the square rather than the absolute value of teh total loss differences. Because of the squaring, this function penalizes values further away from the prediction line (translation, not good if multiple outliers present in data, use L1 instead)\n",
    "* L2(actual, predicted) = (actual - predicted)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above loss functions can fall prey to overfitting\n",

    "\n",
    "In the function above, complexity is some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis that is user defined and is related to the complexity of the expected regression line data and outcome. The idea is to give preference to simpler results (straight line) over more complex (overfitting examples), there needs to be a balance between the loss and the complexity, and this is represented by the lambda $\\lambda$ and is a value chosen to scale complexity. \n",
