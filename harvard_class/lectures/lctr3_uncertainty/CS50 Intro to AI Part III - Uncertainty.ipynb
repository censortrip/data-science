    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability** - is a numerical description of how likely an event is to occur or how likely it is that a proposition is true. Probability is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Theory** - the branch of mathematics concerned with probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ($\\omega$) - indicates a possible world containing different potential outcomes (example, when you roll a die, there are six possible worlds that could result, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Each possible world has some probablity of being true. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* P($\\omega$) - P(w) indicates the probablity of world $\\omega$ occuring or being true\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Range** - probabilities fall between 0 <= P(w) <= 1, where 0 would be an impossibile event (rolling a 7 for example) and 1 would mean an event is certain. In a die example there are 6 possible probabilities for each die side. All the probablities together have to sum to 1, for a die this would be 1/6 given a singlel roll. \n",
    "* Example: P(2) = 1/6 (the probablity of rolling a 2 with 6-sided die is 1/6)\n",
    "   \n",
    "  \n",
    "If two dice are used and we want to get the probabilties of the end result of rolling both, then we need to consider all possible worlds that can be created by both together ((1,1), (2,1), (3,1)....(6,6)), with set dice, the probablities for each are equal with a pair just like with a single die taken together. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the values are summed rather than taken individually between dice,then things change. For example in that world there is only one possible 12 value outcome (roll two 6's) and 1 possible 2 value outcome (tolltwo 1's), whereas, 7 has the most possibile outcomes at 6. So it stands to reason that rolling a 7 should be more probably overall than rolling a 12 or a 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: total number of possible rolls is just w^w or 6^6 = 36\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: P(sum to 12) = 1/36 and  P(sum to 7) = 6/36 or 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unconditional Probability** -  Also known as marginal probability, unconditional probability reflects the chances that some event will occur without accounting for any other possible influences or prior outcomes. The calculation is the same as relative frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For instance, the chance of a fair coin flip being heads has an unconditional probability of 50% regardless of how many coin flips preceded it, nor if some other event had occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "* P(A) = total number of A / all possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional Probability** - Conditional probability is defined as the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring, based on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome., formally:\n",
    "* P(a | b), the probability of a depends on b happening\n",
    "    * Example 1: P(rain today | rain yesterday)\n",
    "    * Example 2: P(route change | traffic conditions)\n",
    "    * Example 3: P(disease | test results)\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Calculating Conditional Probability\n",
    "* P(a | b) = P(a and b) / P(b), probability of a given b is the probability of a and b being true / probablity of b by itself\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously with unconditionaly probablity we say that you have a 1/36 chance of rolling a 12 with two dice. Below, the dice example is used with conditional probablity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* P(sum 12 | 6-roll), what is the probability that two dice sum to 12 given we know one is already 6.\n",
    "    * first need the individual probabilities for give 6 which is 1/6\n",
    "    * then need the unconditional probablity of both rolling a 12, which was 1/36, P(sum 12 and roll 6) = 1/36\n",
    "    * then you divide the probablity of both by the known to get the final probability, in this case 1/6, so P(sum 12 | roll6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Variable** - a variable in probability theory with a domain of possible values it can take on, \n",
    "* Example 1: roll = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, where roll is the random variable and the values in the set are all possibe values the random variable can take on\n",
    "* Example 2: weather = {sun, cloud, rain, wind, snow}, note that random variable values do not have to be numerical. \n",

    "**Probability Distribution** - is the probablity for each value in a random variable\n",
    " \n",
    "**Probability Distribution Example:**\n",
    "* P(Flight = on time)   = 0.6\n",
    "* P(Flight = delayed)   = 0.3\n",
    "* P(Flight = cancelled) = 0.1\n",
    "* All the probabilities for the possible values (or worlds) from the variable flight equal 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectors** are often used to display probability distributions like:\n",
    "* **P**(Flight) = <0.6, 0.3, 0.1>, bold **P** denotes probability distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Independence** - the knowledge that one event occurs does not affect the probability of the other even, P(a and b) = P(a) * P(b)\n",
    "* Example 1: (roll 6 on die1 AND roll 6 on die2) = P(6) * P(6) = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: note that just because that each individual die roll has the same probablity, different die roll combinations DO NOT**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example 2: (roll 6 on die1 AND roll 4 on die2) != P(6) * P(4), these events are NOT independent, the formula would then be: P(a and b) = P(b) * P(a | b) \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Probability Rules\n",

    "**General Multiplication Rule** - consists of the two formulas used in the previous examples:\n",
    "* independent events = P(a and b) = P(a) * P(b)\n",
    "* dependent events = P(a and b) = P(b) * P (a | b)\n",
    "* note that P(a and b) = P(a) * P (b | a) is equivalent to above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayes' Rule (or theorem)** - In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if the risk of developing health problems is known to increase with age, Bayesâ€™ theorem allows the risk to an individual of a known age to be assessed more accurately than simply assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole\n",
    "* $ P(b | a) = P(a | b) * P(b) / P(a) $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayes' Rule Example**\n",
    "* Given clouds in the am, what' the probability of rain in the afternoon?\n",
    "* Assume we know this info: 80% of rainy afternoons start with cloudy mornings\n",
    "* Assume we know this info: 40% of days have cloudy mornings\n",
    "* Assume we know this info: 10% of days have rainy afternoons\n",
    "* Formula: P(rain|clouds) = P(clouds|rain) * P(rain) / P(clouds)\n",
    "* Solution: (.80)(.1) / .4 = 0.2, or a 20% chance of rain in the afternoon\n",
